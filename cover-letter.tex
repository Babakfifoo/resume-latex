Dear Scandit hiring team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Data Analyst position within the Data Team at Scandit. With a strong background in data analytics and a genuine passion for leveraging data to tackle complex challenges, I have a proven track record of transforming intricate datasets into actionable insights that facilitate effective business decisions. My proficiency in Python, R, and SQL, combined with a curious and hands-on mindset, aligns perfectly with your team's commitment to converting data into knowledge and supporting key stakeholders across the organisation. I am eager to apply my skills to deliver insights that enhance the value provided to Scandit's customers.

Throughout my career, I have specialised in ingesting, cleaning, and enhancing datasets by designing pipelines to gather data from REST APIs. My solid background in database design includes deploying databases in PostgreSQL and managing a DuckDB data lake for research data. A significant achievement has been optimising SQL queries and migrating from Pandas to Polars, which has markedly improved efficiency and calculation times. I am well-versed in creating compelling data visualisations, including graphs and maps, tailored for both clients and presentations. 

My experience in applying econometric and machine learning models to quantitative research demonstrates my capability to formulate questions and develop data-driven answers. I am confident that my technical expertise and collaborative approach would make me a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for your time considering my application.

Sincerely yours,

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

Dear W채rtsil채 hiring team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Engineer position. I had the opportunity to attend the DataTribe meetup at W채rtsil채 HQ, and I must say that the environmental goals achieved through data-driven solutions resonate deeply with me. My analytical mindset and proven problem-solving abilities, demonstrated through my experience in deploying production systems and managing complex data platforms, align well with your requirements for configuring, validating, and deploying statistical models while maintaining a robust data infrastructure.

My technical background is particularly relevant to your core responsibilities. I am proficient in Python and have hands-on experience with the scientific Python ecosystem; I have recently led a migration from Pandas to Polars to optimise performance in production environments. Additionally, I possess extensive knowledge of spatial data science, which I believe can further benefit your team. I have successfully deployed Azure functions for reliable, automated data collection and have considerable experience in building and maintaining data pipelines. I understand the importance of data monitoring and have actively addressed technical debt by updating unit tests and refining pipeline architectures. Furthermore, I have a foundational understanding of statistical models and am comfortable working at the intersection of data science and engineering, which positions me well to debug production issues and enhance your automated data processing machinery. While I am still developing my expertise in time-series data and maritime technology, I am a fast learner with a proven track record of quickly acquiring domain knowledge and applying it effectively.

Beyond my technical skills, I appreciate collaborative environments that embrace diverse perspectives. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team's success.

Yours sincerely,

Foolish Babak Firoozi

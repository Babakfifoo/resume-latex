Dear OP Financial Group's hiring team,

I am excited to apply for the Developer Trainee position in the Anti-Financial Crime tribe. I am passionate about software development and eager to explore new technologies. I believe my technical skills can contribute to creating effective and secure solutions. The collaborative and hands-on environment you offer is a perfect match for my proactive approach, and I am eager to learn from experienced developers while gaining real-world experience in software development within the financial sector.

During my studies and previous roles, I have gained experience in SQL, R, and Python for data management during my Ph.D. candidacy. I understand the importance of these skills for this position and feel confident in my ability to handle complex datasets. I have experience using Python for production systems and performance optimisation; I have also worked with Azure for cloud deployments and data collection. I am committed to best practices in development, including automating tests and enhancing data pipelines, and I am eager to apply cloud technologies, AI, and data management in my future role at OP Financial Group.

I thrive in team settings and strive to meet the needs of all stakeholders. I am also quick to learn new programming languages, including SAS, to ensure project success. I believe my enthusiasm for learning, teamwork, and real-world application of technology makes me a strong candidate for the Investigation Tools or Systems team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills can benefit the Anti-Financial Crime tribe.


Sincerely yours, 

- Babak Firoozi Fooladi

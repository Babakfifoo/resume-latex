Dear Kone hiring team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the internship position within KONE's Strategy & Transformation unit. Having recently completed a PhD at Aalto University, I have extensive experience in data analytics engineering and data science, with a proven track record of delivering strategic insights through complex analyses. My background uniquely positions me to excel in SQL, Power BI, and other data analysis tools. During my doctoral research, I developed advanced analytical capabilities by performing econometric modelling, machine learning applications, and statistical analysis on large-scale datasets. I designed and deployed PostgreSQL and DuckDB data lakes, implemented RAG systems for document processing, and created visualisations for stakeholder presentations.

My professional experience exemplifies the consulting-style approach this role requires. At WSP Finland, I delivered spatial data analysis and network forecasting for urban planning projects, collaborating closely with engineers, planners, and clients. As a data analytics engineer for two startups, I consult on generative AI implementation, optimising data processing pipelines, and enhancing system architecture.

I am confident that my combination of advanced analytical skills, business understanding, and collaborative approach would make me a valuable addition to your team. What excites me most about KONE is the opportunity to apply data-driven analysis to strategic business challenges within a global organisation. I am eager to contribute my proactive attitude and problem-solving abilities to your strategic projects. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to discussing how my experience aligns with KONE's needs.
Yours sincerely,

Foolish Babak Firoozi

Dear BCG recruiting team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the internship position at BCG. Throughout my diverse experiences and academic background, I have developed a fascination with how technology can enhance everyday work processes. My personal interest in IT has provided me with a solid understanding of computer functionality, key concepts, and their real-world applications.

As a Ph.D. student, my service-orientated mindset and eagerness to learn about new technologies led me to take on the roles of data steward and IT advisor within my research team. I have become well-acquainted with the expectations and requirements necessary to ensure quality services that meet user needs. Additionally, my experience in optimising code for Apex-heat has equipped me with the essential skills for delivering high-quality software services.

I am confident that my strong analytical and conceptual abilities, combined with a collaborative approach, make me a compelling candidate for this role. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams and feel particularly at ease in global contexts, where I can effectively communicate complex topics. Highly motivated and detail-orientated, I am prepared to develop IT-related project content independently and contribute to your team's mission of transforming digital visions into reality. Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and this exciting role further.

Sincerely,

Babäk Firoozi Fooladi

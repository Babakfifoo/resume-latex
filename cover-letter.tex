Dear Aeromon hiring team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position in Aeromon. With a strong background in data analytics, a Ph.D. in the built environment, and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems, I am confident that my skills and experience align perfectly with your team's mission to contribute to emission control and a cleaner environment.

Throughout my career, I have developed a robust analytical mindset and extensive experience handling, analysing, and reporting complex datasets. As a Data Analytics Engineer at Qissa kaupunkisuunnitteluanalytiikka Oy, I processed data from various APIs to calculate COâ‚‚ emissions from commuting, which is a direct match for the core responsibilities of this role. My Ph.D. research at Aalto University provided a deep understanding of econometric and machine learning models, especially in spatial econometrics. I am highly proficient in database design, SQL optimisation, and data visualisation for presentations. The job description mentions an independent working style, which my recent self-employed role has further honed, strengthening my problem-solving abilities and resilience. I am eager to use this skill to analyse sensor data, contribute to customer reports, and provide technical support.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to your team and helping to create a cleaner environment. I have attached one of the examples of data analysis I presented for the City of Helsinki as the additional document and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely yours,

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

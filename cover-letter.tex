	\section{Cover Letter}

Dear Laura,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the geopolitical analyst position. My career has centred on conducting research in real estate economics, land policies, and public interventions. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to apply structured analysis to global geopolitical risks, as well as to learn and acquire information that will benefit your startup.

The structured analytic techniques that are essential for this role have significantly influenced my academic and professional background. As a Ph.D. candidate at Aalto, I routinely manage complex datasets and apply econometric, machine learning (ML), and time-to-event statistical models. My practical experience includes performing deep-dive GIS analysis, designing data pipelines, and implementing RAG to extract structured data from complex documents, which demonstrates my capability in acquiring data from any openly available sources. Additionally, my work in extracting and processing census data from international markets showcases my ability to synthesise global trends into quantifiable outcomes.

Beyond analysis, my experience in startup environments, including consulting on generative AI at Apex-Heat and designing data infrastructure at Qissa, reflects my eagerness to contribute to product development. I possess proficiency in Python, R, and database design (PostgreSQL/DuckDB), which equips me to help shape your SaaS platform for effective geopolitical risk management. I thrive on making an impact, and I am ready to leverage my analytical rigour and technical expertise to join your innovative product team.

Sincerely,

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

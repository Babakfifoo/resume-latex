Dear Nordhealth Hiring Team,

I am thrilled to submit my application for the AI Engineer Intern position at Nordhealth. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at Aalto University, where I have developed a strong foundation in data integration, automation, and applied machine learning. My academic and technical experiences have not only equipped me with strong quantitative research skills, but they have also ignited my passion for understanding how AI can responsibly revolutionise industries, especially healthcare.

In my doctoral research, I designed and implemented comprehensive data pipelines using PostgreSQL, DuckDB, and Azure Functions. This work involved integrating various APIs such as REST, WFS, and GraphQL while ensuring high standards of data quality and reproducibility. Furthermore, I have applied these skills professionally as an independent analytics engineer, where I successfully navigated complex codebases, collaborated with various stakeholders, and transformed technical insights into practical solutions. These experiences have sharpened my ability to structure, evaluate, and communicate technical findings.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the prospect of working at the convergence of technology and healthcare to ensure that AI models are not only accurate and transparent but also centred on human needs. I understand the severity and criticality of the accuracy of AI, especially in the healthcare industry. Therefore, I am particularly eager to explore prompt engineering, develop automated evaluation pipelines, and analyse the performance of large language models to tackle challenges such as bias and hallucination. I am confident that my technical expertise, research discipline, and dedication to responsible AI make me an excellent candidate for your team.

Sincerely yours, 

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

Dear Orion hiring team,

I am genuinely excited about the Data Analyst position at Orion. My service-minded approach, coupled with extensive quantitative research and engineering experience, aligns perfectly with your requirement for a professional capable of managing complex datasets and producing dashboards, data visualisation and reports. My curiosity and adaptability motivate me to tailor all data-driven solutions to meet stakeholder requirements.

My CV outlines hands-on experience across multiple technical stacks, enabling me to select the most suitable tools based on accuracy, cost, and performance. I am proficient in Python, R, Julia, and STATA, having developed dashboards using Shiny, Streamlit, and Dash-Plotly, as well as Power BI and Tableau. Importantly, I use Python for production systems and complex data platforms, a choice supported by its robust, industry-standard capabilities. My engineering expertise includes deploying Azure functions for reliable data collection, leading a migration from Pandas to Polars for performance optimisation, and actively addressing technical debt, such as updating unit tests and refining data pipelines. 

In addition to my technical skills, I possess the soft skills necessary to address the needs of the teams and produce tailored dashboards. I approach all tasks with precision and punctuality, ensuring that solutions consistently align with stakeholder expectations. I am confident that my commitment, ethics, and professional skills make me an ideal candidate. I appreciate your time and look forward to discussing how my expertise can benefit Orion.

Sincerely yours,

Foolish Babak Firoozi

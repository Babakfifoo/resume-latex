Dear hiring team,


I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at Futurice. My experience with generative AI and large language models (LLMs), particularly in processing and extracting information from documents using RAG and CAG methods, closely aligns with the requirements of this role.

I am passionate about applying LLMs, vector embeddings, and retrieval systems to develop applications for text generation, summarization, and content recommendation. My interest in agentic design and the coordinated use of generative AI agents has shaped my approach to achieving reliable outcomes. With a background in research and real estate, as well as experience in understanding industry needs, I have developed a vision for using LLMs as a translation layer between human sentiment, text, and machine commands.

Beyond my technical skills, I am skilled at advising stakeholders and supporting data-driven decision-making with a service-oriented mindset. I am committed to the responsible use of AI and understand the broader impact of LLMs on society. I am confident that my skills and experience would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely yours,

Babäk Firoozi Fooladi

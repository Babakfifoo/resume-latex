Dear Fortum Hiring Team,

I am eager to apply for the Data Analyst position at Fortum, as I believe my background in research and planning assistant roles aligns seamlessly with the role's requirements. My experience encompasses both academic and professional environments, where I have developed data pipelines, deployed databases for research data, and conducted complex statistical and network analyses.

I possess strong skills in SQL and data warehousing, and I am proficient in creating data visualisations and dashboards. Despite my limited experience with Power BI, my eagerness to improve my skills in this field is evident. My tenure with startups has equipped me with expertise to optimise data processes, including migrating from Pandas to Polars and improving SQL query performance, which I am confident will be an asset to your team.

As an analytical and structured individual with a curiosity for problem-solving, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can hear and communicate diverse ideas. I am driven to transform data into useful insights, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Fortum's performance analytics. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and enthusiasm can benefit your team.

sincerely yours,

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

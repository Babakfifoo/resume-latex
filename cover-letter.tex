Dear Vaisala hiring team,

I am writing to express my keen enthusiasm for the Data Scientist position, where I can leverage my expertise in time series analysis to beneficial effect. As an Iranian, I possess a profound understanding of the significance of climate change, resilience, and adaptation. Therefore, the opportunity to apply my analytical skills to tackle these challenges aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations.

My background in quantitative research, coupled with my experience in structuring and processing time-series data for the real estate sector, qualifies me for this role. My strong proficiency in Python and a solid foundation in statistical analysis, along with my ability to learn quickly, enable me to experiment effectively with various modelling approaches and implement the latest models for practical applications. Additionally, my previous experience in refining data pipelines and implementing unit tests ensures that I can contribute immediately to reproducible research practices and the robust integration of promising models into larger workflows. Lastly, my familiarity with spatial data and spatio-temporal analysis can offer added value to Vaisala.

I take pride in being a proactive, solution-orientated, and collaborative individual—traits that I believe are essential for effective cross-disciplinary work with engineers, scientists, and commercial experts. I am eager to help advance Vaisala Xweather's applied machine learning capabilities and look forward to discussing how my expertise can drive actionable insights and support the development of smarter, safer solutions for a changing world.

Sincerely,

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

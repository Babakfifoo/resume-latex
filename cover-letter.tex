Dear Sievo Hiring Team,

My interest in the Data Engineer position is strong. As an Aalto University Ph.D. candidate with data integration and pipeline development experience, I want to work with clients on real-world business problems.

I developed and implemented end-to-end data solutions that meet your job description's key duties during my research. I managed data infrastructure with PostgreSQL and DuckDB, automated data collection with Azure functions, and ETL/ELT pipelines from various APIs, including REST, GraphQL and GeoServers. As the lead for my team's research data infrastructure, I built robust systems for acquiring, processing, and storing real estate transaction data, which reflects this position's requirements gathering and pipeline design.

I've solved complex data problems with practical solutions, meeting your expectations. In addition to research, I worked as an independent analytics engineer for Apex-Heat, navigating complex codebases and receiving positive feedback. This experience has improved my technical communication and stakeholder management, which I want to develop in a customer-facing role.

I like this job because I can work with clients to understand their data issues and create custom integration solutions. I am service-minded and familiar with various fields and industries. My academic training gave me a methodical and logical approach to problem solving and a thorough investigative mindset, especially when it comes to recognising and identifying clients' needs. Data integration requires careful technical implementation and effective client communication, which I acknowledge because of my attention to detail.

Even though I study research, my self-taught programming and data science education show my commitment to learning. I want to use my technical skills in business as a data engineer and trusted advisor. I would like to discuss how my technical expertise, analytical mindset, and passion for client collaboration can help your team deliver impactful data solutions.

Sincerely, 

Babak Firoozi Fooladi

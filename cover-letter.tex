	\section{Cover Letter}

Dear Beneq hiring team,

I am composing this letter to express my interest in the Warehouse Operator position at Beneq. My diverse work experience and background as a Ph.D. candidate at Aalto University have endowed me with a strong sense of organisation, systematic thinking, and service-mindedness. Throughout my time at WSP Finland and in my family business in Iran, I have worked in a manufacturing environment and collaborated with cross-functional teams. This experience has allowed me to effectively engage with sourcing, purchasing, and manufacturing processes, thereby ensuring operational efficiency and smooth material flow.

Throughout my career, I have cultivated excellent attention to detail and a structured work style, both of which are crucial for maintaining inventory accuracy, ensuring quality control of shipments, and upholding warehouse organisation standards, such as 5S. My proficiency in IT systems and my ability to learn quickly will enable me to master various software applications with ease. Consequently, I look forward to the challenge of mastering SAP and warehouse management tools. I am comfortable communicating in English. Although my background is primarily analytical, I am eager to apply my problem-solving skills and learning capabilities to meet your needs.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on Beneq's daily operations and to develop new skills in industrial logistics. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my organisational abilities, positive attitude, and willingness to learn could contribute to the success of your warehouse team.

Yours sincerely,
Babak Firoozi Fooladi

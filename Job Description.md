# Short term job for a data analyst / SDM specialist / coder

Duration: 6-8 months – with a possibility of extension and/or developing your own research project
Salary type: personal grant (3 200 e/month tax-free)
The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Data uncertainty in conservation planning (DUC) -research project:
This project explores what types of data and modelling uncertainties influence conservation plans the most. The project focuses especially on biodiversity data and species distribution models, and their use in spatial planning and decision-making.

Job description:
The person hired for this job will assist in the cleaning, harmonising and exploration of data used to run species distribution models, and the development of a semi-automated modelling pipeline. This includes, but is not restricted to, work done with FinBIF data (Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility, <www.laji.fi>). The work can be tailored depending on the skillsets of the hired person, emphasising either more data wrangling and analysis vs modelling, for example. Depending on the lab’s funding situation, there may be possibilities for extension, but these cannot be guaranteed at this point. We’re also happy to support our employees to develop their own research projects associated to our research themes, and can provide guidance on the writing of funding applications. This could be an ideal job for someone who has just finished or is about to finish their PhD and who are looking for a short-term job. The work will be supervised by Prof Heini Kujala (Luomus) and Dr Elina Virtanen (Luomus / Syke) and will be placed at the Natural History museum of Finland (Luomus).

Our ideal candidate has:

- PhD in statistical ecology or similar – persons with a Master’s degree but with strong skills are also encouraged to apply
- Good data processing and management skills (preferably in R)
- Experience in working with:
  - large data sets
  - species distribution models
  - spatial data
- Knowledge on the building and use of species distribution models more broadly
- Ability to code scripts to process large data amounts. Familiarity to work with CSC environments is a plus but not mandatory
• Good work motivation and ability to finalise tasks in a given time

If you meet any of these criteria and are interested in topic, please consider applying! We’re also happy to provide more information if you have any questions.

ANALYTICS DEVELOPER 

to join our dynamic Data and Insights team at Marimekko's Technology function at HQ in Helsinki. This is a full-time permanent position, in which you will report to Marimekko's Head of Data and Insights.

As an Analytics Developer with an engineering mindset, you will play a key role in strengthening our data-driven decision-making across the company. You will combine technical expertise with business acumen to deliver insights, build data products, and support strategic initiatives using modern data tools and reporting platforms. Your mission is to transform data into actionable business value by creating meaningful reporting, collaborating closely with business stakeholders, and supporting practical applications such as marketing data activation.

We are looking for someone who is technically skilled and brings a proactive, structured, and goal-oriented approach in working — someone who takes ownership, follows through on tasks, and continuously looks for opportunities to improve and create value.

Your role will focus on ensuring high data quality, building efficient analytics pipelines, and delivering impactful reports and analyses — primarily using Snowflake and Power BI. In addition, you will contribute to initiatives where customer and commercial data are combined from multiple sources (e.g. CRM, e-commerce, store sales) and activated for marketing purposes — such as building audience lists for marketing platforms. You'll be part of a team that values trust, collaboration, and purposeful execution — working at the intersection of technology and commercial impact.

Main responsibilities:

Data Engineering & Analytics

Developing and maintaining robust data models and pipelines in Snowflake to ensure reliable, high-quality data for analysis and activation.
Supporting business users in creating and using Power BI reports and dashboards, ensuring they can easily access insights that drive decision-making across functions.
Identifying opportunities to automate data processes, improve reporting efficiency, and enhance data usability.

Business Insight, Data Activation & Collaboration

Working closely with business owners and stakeholders, understanding their needs and translating them into data solutions.
Supporting data activation use cases — for example, combining customer data across systems to create audience segments for marketing platforms or personalized campaigns.
Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis to support business growth and operational excellence.
Contributing to defining key metrics and ensuring consistency in reporting across teams.
Applying knowledge of retail and marketing processes to ensure analyses and activations are relevant and impactful for commercial teams.

Continuous Improvement & AI Readiness

Promoting best practices in data governance, quality, and documentation.
Staying current with trends in analytics, data activation, and AI; proactively suggesting enhancements where appropriate.
Collaborating with internal teams on initiatives that prepare us for future AI or machine learning use cases.

To be successful in this role you should have:

Relevant educational background, preferably a degree from in Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics, or a related technical field.
Background in retail and/or marketing analytics is a strong advantage.
Hands-on experience working with Snowflake or similar cloud data warehouse technologies.
Strong skills in Power BI (or comparable BI tools) for reporting and visualization.
Solid SQL knowledge; ability to design efficient queries and data transformations.
Experience or understanding of data activation use cases — e.g. creating audience segments for marketing platforms by combining data from CRM, e-commerce, and other sources.
Strong business understanding and ability to engage with non-technical stakeholders.
Proactive and structured working style with a focus on delivering results and creating business value.
Goal-oriented mindset with a pragmatic approach to problem solving.
Interest and basic familiarity with AI/ML concepts and their potential business applications.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to present complex data in a clear and compelling way.
Fluent in English; Finnish language skills are seen as an advantage

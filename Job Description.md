# JUNIOR DATA ENGINEER

Would you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We’re looking for Junior Data Engineers who are eager to grow their skills and get more hands-on experience with modern data solutions, platforms, and pipelines. Working at Recordly means you’ll get to collaborate with customers who truly want to make data their competitive edge. You will be part of a talented work community that helps businesses make the most of the opportunities data offers. You’ll gain practical experience with a wide range of technologies and advance your data skills.

“WHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?” YOU MIGHT ASK
At Recordly, we specialize in creating value for our customers with data and AI solutions. We believe a significant data transformation is taking place, but many companies are facing challenges in actualizing its full potential. With experienced, data-focused people, we help companies unlock the full value of this transformation.

Our mission is to define how humans and data co-operate. We want to support businesses in understanding the data they already have, the business opportunities data possesses they’re not yet realizing, and how to use these to enhance strategic KPIs. Simultaneously, we aim to translate business requirements into actionable tasks for teams working with the data or related technologies. Through this collaboration with our customers, we aspire to drive and accelerate a broader data transformation movement.

In more traditional terms, our core business revolves around data management, data engineering, data architectures, data & AI strategy and governance as well as hands-on AI solutions - all of which enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, and new business models. We also get our hands dirty with real-time data, ML/GenAI solutions or building enterprise-level ML platforms with modern state of the art data tech stacks. We’re tech-agnostic, but some of our most commonly used tools include Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, dbt, and Databricks. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data. What sets us apart is who we are and how we do it.

Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments, of course) includes the possibility of enjoying the company's success and shaping who we are and what we do together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how our choices affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better!

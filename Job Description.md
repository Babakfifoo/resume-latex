# About The Role

We are here to create great healthcare products. That’s at our very core, but it’s the people who make companies great, not the other way around.

Your Key Responsibilities Include

Design and implement prompt engineering techniques to optimize LLMs for healthcare-related tasks
Experiment with different prompts, tuning strategies, and model parameters to improve model reliability and accuracy in healthcare use cases
Develop and automate evaluation pipelines for assessing the performance of LLMs in healthcare scenarios.
Analyze LLM outputs for potential issues such as bias, hallucinations, and medical inaccuracies, and propose solutions
Document and present findings to both internal teams

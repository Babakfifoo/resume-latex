About Lyceum

Lyceum is building a user-centric GPU cloud from the ground up. Our mission is to make high-performance computing seamless, accessible, and tailored to the needs of modern AI and ML workloads. We're not just deploying infrastructure, we're designing and building our own large-scale GPU clusters from scratch. If you've ever wanted to help shape a cloud platform from day one, this is your moment.


The Role

We're looking for a Data Scientist Intern to join our product team and help us bridge real-world AI/ML workflows with our platform. You'll support experiments, benchmarks, and user-facing resources that make Lyceum the default compute backbone for modern data science and life sciences AI.
This internship is hands-on: you'll work closely with engineers and users, gain exposure to large-scale GPU workloads, and help turn insights into tangible improvements in product and onboarding.


What You'll Do

Support the analysis of data pipelines to identify bottlenecks and pain points
Help translate user insights into clear specs and priorities for the product team
Contribute to reference workflows and benchmarks (Python/ML)
Assist in creating quickstarts, guides, and onboarding materials
Run small experiments and evaluations to measure performance and impact


What We're Looking For

Background in Data Science, Computer Science, or Life Sciences (bioinformatics, computational biology, medical imaging, or similar fields)
Solid Python/ML skills and an interest in experimentation & evaluation methods
Basic data handling skills (SQL/analytics, reproducibility practices)
Curiosity for GPU workloads and performance optimization
Clear communication skills and an eagerness to document learnings


Bonus Points

Exposure to large-scale datasets (e.g. single-cell, pathology, protein/chemistry)
Familiarity with data governance or QA in health/clinical contexts
Contributions to open-source projects or public technical writing


Why Join Us

Learn fast: Get exposure to cutting-edge GPU infrastructure and real ML workloads
Real impact: Contribute to features, guides, and benchmarks that users rely on
Early-stage experience: See how product, engineering, and customer feedback come together in a startup
Mentorship & growth: Work closely with experienced engineers and scientists in AI infra


Lyceum is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees and interns.

Developer Trainee, AFC Tribe (2 positions)
Company:  OP Osuuskunta
Job Location:  Helsinki, Oulu
Contract Type:  Temporary
Posting End Date:  19/10/2025
The application period for OP Financial Group's 2026 Kiitorata Trainee Program is now open! We are looking for approximately 40 open-minded and courageous talents for diverse, challenging, and skill-enhancing roles in various business areas.

Are you our future top developer of banking services? Do you want to grow your expertise alongside industry leaders and help build the world's best banking services - especially in the areas of credit risk management and financial data development?

We're strengthening our Software Engineering department and are now looking for two motivated Developer Trainees to join us in Helsinki or Oulu.

A few words about the job

We're looking for two Developer Trainees to join our Anti-Financial crime tribe - one for the Investigation Tools team and the other for the System team.

As a Developer Trainee, you'll take part in hands-on development, solution architecture design, and coding. You'll work as part of a skilled team that builds solutions efficiently and securely. You'll collaborate closely with product owners, your own team, and external stakeholders.

During the traineeship, you'll gain practical experience in how agile software development is done in the financial sector - and you'll have the opportunity to influence how the team works. The content and focus of the traineeship can be tailored to match your previous experience and areas of interest.

Does this sound like you?

You are a future developer in the final stages of your university studies or recently graduated, inspired by software development and modern technologies. Through your studies and/or previous work experience, you've gained hands-on programming skills in several languages, such as Java and React.

In this role, you'll be working extensively with SQL, so strong skills in that area are essential. We also hope you have experience with the following: test automation, Python, Azure, and Git. If you also have skills in SAS, that will earn you significant bonus points during the selection process.

You're ready to learn a new programming language whenever needed. You're excited about cloud technologies and want to incorporate AI and data management into your future work. You communicate fluently in English.

You're proactive and have a strong desire to grow and learn from experienced developers. Success in this role is supported by strong collaboration and teamwork skills, as well as a passion for learning and applying technology in practice. 

A few words about us and why you should work for us

At OP, you will work on challenging tasks of daily life, and in addition to gaining a vast amount of life skills and new expertise, you will be a part of Finland's most attractive financial industry player.  With your actions and a determined attitude, you can influence your own career path here. We support your personal development and encourage you boldly! You will be employed by OP for a paid six-month contract from March 1 to August 31, 2026, and we offer the same salary to you and all trainee colleagues; â‚¬3,150 per month.

As a counterbalance to responsible work, we take care of your well-being and future-oriented work arrangements. We offer you a stable environment where responsibility, human touch, and mutual success are key values.

You get access to our versatile staff benefits, which include a staff fund as well as staff-based banking, insurance, and loan services. We also offer comprehensive occupational health care, extensive medical expense insurance, and full-time accident insurance. We invest in everyday balance and flexibility as well as offering you lunch, exercise, and cultural benefits and the opportunity for inexpensive vacations in OP vacation shares.
